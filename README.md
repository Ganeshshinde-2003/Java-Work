# Java Code Repository
This repository contains Java code written over the last few days, including a calculator project. The code here is intended to be used as a reference for anyone looking to learn Java or improve their Java skills.
## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you can simply clone it to your local machine using the command:

```https://github.com/Ganeshshinde-2003/Java-Work.git```

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Java code in this repository, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repository to your local machine and have the necessary prerequisites installed, you can import the code into your IDE and begin working with it.

## Usage

The Java code in this repository is organized into different packages based on their functionality. Each package contains one or more Java classes with methods that perform specific tasks.

In addition, there is a file called Main.java that contains all the basic concepts of Java, including loops, conditional statements, and other fundamental concepts. Each concept is described with comments, making it a great resource for anyone learning Java.

To use the code in this repository, you can either call the methods directly from your own Java application, or you can run the code as standalone applications.

To explore the Main.java file, simply open it in your IDE or text editor of choice. You can read through the comments to learn about each concept and see examples of how they can be used.

# Calculator Mini-Project

This repository also contains a calculator project implemented in Java. The calculator project is a simple command-line application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

To use the calculator, simply run the Calculator.java file in your IDE or from the command line. You will be prompted to enter the first number, the second number and the choice to select the operator. The calculator will then perform the requested operation and display the result.

Feel free to use the calculator project as a starting point for your own Java projects, or to modify it to fit your own needs.
